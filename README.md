# Loan_Default_Pred

     Loans are the core business of banks. The main profit comes directly from the loan’s interest. The loan companies grant a loan after an intensive process of verification and validation. However, they still don’t have assurance if the applicant is able to repay the loan with no difficulties. A loan default occurs when a borrower takes money from a bank and does not repay the loan. People often default on loans due to various reasons. Borrowers who default on loans not only damage their credit but also risk being sued and having their wages garnished. So there is a need for a predicting loan default. Solution is to build a classification model (Supervised Machine Learning) in which the target variable must need to be classified whether the loan will be approved or not (Yes | No).

# Loan_Default_Pred

Loans are the core business of banks. The main profit comes directly from the loan’s interest. The loan companies grant a loan after an intensive process of verification and validation. However, they still don’t have assurance if the applicant is able to repay the loan with no difficulties. A loan default occurs when a borrower takes money from a bank and does not repay the loan. People often default on loans due to various reasons. Borrowers who default on loans not only damage their credit but also risk being sued and having their wages garnished. So there is a need for a predicting loan default. Solution is to build a classification model (Supervised Machine Learning) in which the target variable must need to be classified whether the loan will be approved or not (Yes | No). 

The app consists of some folders : 

1. Static which consists of css and image files. 
2. Templates which has html files. 
3. The python file app.py, which has the codes for running a flask app. 
4. The pickle file model.pkl, which has the developed model in it. 
5. Finally includes the preprocessed and sampled data. 

To run the app locally, we code “python app.py” in the terminal prompt and the link generated is copied and pasted into the local browser to view and run the application.
